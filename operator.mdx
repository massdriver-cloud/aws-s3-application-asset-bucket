# aws-s3-application-asset-bucket
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that provides developers with a secure and cost-effective way to store and retrieve any amount of data. It offers a simple API interface and enables applications to easily store and retrieve images, videos, audio files, and other assets without worrying about capacity, availability, or data loss.

## Use Cases
### Asset Serving for API
Many APIs need persistent blob storage for artifacts/manifests/objects that aren't suitable for storage in a database.
### Media Storage
Amazon S3 provides an ideal solution for storing and delivering media assets, such as images, videos, and audio files, for web and mobile applications.
### Backup and Disaster Recovery
S3 can be used to backup important application assets, such as code, configurations, and databases, to ensure they are always available in the event of a disaster or outage.
### Machine Learning Model Storage
Large machine learning models can store model data in S3 and load it as needed by applications

## Design
This bundle is designed around the specific use-case of storing application assets in S3. For this reason, assumptions are made regarding the configuration of the bucket. For example, public access is disabled, object versioning is disabled.

## Best Practices
### High Availability
Deploys regional S3 for High availability in the event of zonal failure
### Dedicated KMS Key
Uses a dedicated KMS key with narrowly scoped permission for encryption

## Security
### KMS Encryption
A KMS key is created and narrowly scoped to the bucket for encrypting all assets.
### Private ACL
No public access is allowed to this bucket

## Policies
The following policies are created for managing access to the S3 bucket.
* `read`: Grants read access to objects in the bucket
* `write`: Grants access to write objects to the bucket

## Non-intentions / Out of Scope Use-cases  (for this bundle)
- Eventing bucket for lambda ETL (would include notifications)
- Static Website Content (would include routing / endpoint configuration)
- Cold / Archival storage only
- Data Lake (analytics configuration and option for transfer accelerate configuration)
- Replication to other regions
- Requester Pays user content download
- Log Storage
